Network Programming (My Reports)
Here I uploaded reports of my Network Programming tasks.
Inside, you can find my documentations with codes covering topics like:

**Client-server** architecture (iterative and concurrent models)

**TCP and UDP socket programming** in C and Java

Networking on **Linux** and **Windows** platforms

**Non-blocking sockets** and **multi-service servers**

**Embedded server** development

Practical labs demonstrating real-world networking concepts

This repository reflects my hands-on experience from university coursework and showcases my understanding of core network programming principles.
